The primary objective of this experiment is to investigate and comprehend the impact of translation on points in both 2D and 3D space. Participants will delve into the matrix representation of translation and acquire practical skills in computing the translated coordinates of points. By the end of the experiment, participants should have a clear understanding of how translation transformations influence the spatial positioning of graphical elements and be proficient in utilizing matrix operations to perform translations effectively.
