### Procedure 


1. **Navigating the Interface:**
   - Explore the simulation interface which includes various controls and settings.
   - Use the checkboxes under "Display Settings" to toggle graph locks and grid displays.

2. **Interacting with Shapes:**
   - Add shapes by clicking the "Add" button and selecting a shape type and coordinates.
   - Edit or delete shapes by selecting them and using the respective "Edit" or "Delete" buttons.

3. **Manipulating the Simulation:**
   - Use mouse controls for translation and rotation, and the scroll wheel for zooming.
   - On mobile devices, use touch controls for similar interactions like panning, rotating, and zooming.

4. **Applying Changes and Resetting:**
   - Adjust the transformation matrix and translation vector as needed.
