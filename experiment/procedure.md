## Interactive Simulation Procedure

### 1. Add a Shape:

1. **Click Add Shape:**
   - Click on the **Add Shape** button.
   
2. **Select Shape Coordinates:**
   - Specify the coordinates for the shape.
   
3. **Submit Shape:**
   - Click **Add** to add the specified shape to the simulation.

### 2. Select and Edit Shape:

1. **Click Select Shape:**
   - Use the **Select Shape** option to pick a shape for modification within the simulation.
   
2. **Edit Shape:**
   - Click **Edit Shape** to adjust the properties or position of the selected shape.

### 3. Transformation Matrix for Translation Experiment:

For the translation experiment, the transformation matrix applies a translation to coordinates, shifting shapes across the canvas. The translation coordinates specify how much to move shapes along the x and y axes, altering their position relative to their original coordinates. This technique is crucial for dynamic simulations where objects need to move smoothly within the graphical environment.
